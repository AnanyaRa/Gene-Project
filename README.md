The yeast genome NNF2 in the Kingdom Eukarya has been categorized as putative, essentially unidentified till date. As a 936-amino acid containing protein, it has been observed to have interactions with RPB8P, a subunit of RNA Polymerase. The Saccharomyces Genome Database has claimed that this protein is also thought to have a role in chromosome segregation, a part of meiosis and mitosis.
